This is a great approach to classifying different sections of model documentation. The `classify_section` function will help identify key parts of the white papers, test plans, and test results for further analysis. Let me enhance this with additional functionality to create a more comprehensive solution:

```python

    heading_lower = heading.lower()
    for section_type, patterns in SECTION_PATTERNS.items():

            return section_type
    return 'unclassified'

def extract_document_structure(text):
    """
    Extract the document structure with headings and their content.
    Returns a dictionary mapping heading to content.
    """
    # Regular expression to match headings (adjust as needed for your documents)

    # Find all headings
    headings = heading_pattern.finditer(text)
    
    # Extract sections
    sections = {}
    start_positions = []
    
    for match in headings:
        start_positions.append((match.start(), match.group().strip()))
    
    # Add document end as the final position
    start_positions.append((len(text), "END_OF_DOCUMENT"))
    
    # Extract content between headings
    for i in range(len(start_positions) - 1):
        heading = start_positions[i][1]
        start = start_positions[i][0] + len(heading)
        end = start_positions[i+1][0]
        content = text[start:end].strip()
        sections[heading] = content
    
    return sections

This enhanced solution provides several key improvements:

1. **Document Structure Extraction**: The `extract_document_structure` function identifies headings and their associated content, which helps maintain the document's logical structure.

2. **Section Classification**: Using your `SECTION_PATTERNS`, the code categorizes each section of the document, allowing for targeted analysis of specific components.

3. **Section-Specific Analysis**: The `analyze_specific_section` function uses different prompts tailored to each section type, improving the quality of the analysis.

4. **Testable Elements Extraction**: The solution identifies elements from the model documentation that should be tested, creating a comprehensive list of test requirements.

5. **Gap Analysis**: By comparing testable elements with the test plan and results, the system can identify testing coverage gaps.

6. **Comprehensive Reporting**: The final report includes an executive summary, detailed analysis of model components, testing coverage gaps, and specific recommendations.

To implement this in a production environment, I would recommend:

1. **Web Interface**: Create a Flask or FastAPI web application where users can upload documents and view the analysis results.

2. **Asynchronous Processing**: For large documents, implement asynchronous processing with AWS SQS and Lambda to handle the workload.

3. **Caching**: Implement caching of analysis results to improve performance for frequently accessed documents.

4. **User Feedback Loop**: Allow users to provide feedback on the analysis, which can be used to improve the system over time.

5. **Version Control**: Implement version control for documents and analysis results to track changes over time.

This solution addresses the Internal Audit team's need to efficiently analyze model documentation, identify testing coverage gaps, and minimize the risk of undetected implementation errors in complex models.
